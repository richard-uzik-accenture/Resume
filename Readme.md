# My Resume
## Branching
**During develoment phase we work in development branch, no need for feature branches!**
1. Create a new feature branch from based on development. Name of the branch should be follow this naming convention : 
     * _feature-task-sasscomponentname_ for basic tasks
     * _feature-bug-sasscomponentname_ for bugs
2. Work in feature branch
3. Make atomic commits (focus commit on one : file / component / functionality)
4. Use short descriptive commit messages
5. When work on feature is done, create pull reaquest for development
6. Merge to development and delete feature branch
7. Perform testing of website locally
    * Just some manual testing of responsivity and basic functionality
8. Create pull request to master
9. Check if Github workflow succesfully deployed new version to Azure
